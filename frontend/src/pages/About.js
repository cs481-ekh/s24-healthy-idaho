                        <b>Abstract:</b> The impact of climate change in the Western US, particularly in Idaho, calls for the need of a portal
                        where residents can easily get information on climate-related health issues near them. Understanding climate health effects
                        involves a portal where residents can see the nature and duration of climate extremes, exposure levels, population sensitivity,
                        green areas, and community resilience. Idaho lacks this accessible information on climate-related health issues which hinders
                        the availability of information that public policy makers need and outreach efforts for residents facing these issues.
                        <br></br>
                        To address this problem we propose a web-based application called Healthy Idaho which will contain climate-related health
                        data specific to Idaho’s census tracts. The portal will provide information on heat waves and wildfire smoke exposure across
                        different regions, land surface temperature, access to adaptation measures, and relevant social background information. The portal
                        will have a map segmented based on Idaho’s census tracts which makes it easy for users to see the climate-related health information
                        near them. By providing Idahoans with region-specific climate resources, the portal facilitates informed decision making to understand
                        and act on health risks.

                        climate lengthens and exacerbates warm seasons, heatwaves, and droughts, which results in increased
                        wildfire activity and associated smoke in the Western US. The combination of climate extremes, growing
                        populations in the western US, and an aging population contributes to elevated exposure to grave climate-related
                        health impacts. In fact, thousands to tens of thousands heat-related deaths are projected in the US in a
                        warming climate. Climate health impacts depend on four factors: (1) the nature, intensity, and duration of
                        the climate extreme, (2) the extent of exposure to extremes, (3) the sensitivity and resilience of the exposed
                        population, and (4) the capacity of the community to respond to and manage health risks.

                        Idahoans are vulnerable to a variety of climatic extremes, including wildfire smoke and heatwaves. In 2022,
                        for example, summer temperatures in Boise, ID topped 100  for a record-breaking 25 days. Heatwaves not only
                        can cause heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heatstrokes, and hyperthermia, but also can worsen chronic conditions
                        such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes-related conditions. Furthermore,
                        in 2020 alone, the Gem state observed more than 15 million person-days of exposure to poor air quality – air
                        quality index (AQI) for PM2.5 above 100 – due to wildfire smoke. Wildfire smoke induces a variety of respiratory
                        and cardiovascular effects such as coughing, wheezing, bronchitis, reduced lung function, asthma exacerbation
                        and lung diseases aggravation, heart failure, heart attack, and stroke. It is estimated that from 2008-2013 in
                        the Contiguous US, between 5200 and 8500 respiratory hospital admissions per year occurred due to exposure to
                        wildfire smoke. Idaho is in the bullseye of wildfire smoke impacts in the western US; severe smoky days impact
                        central Idaho for more than 20 days per year, and 10-20 days for the rest of Idaho.

                        access to adaptation measures (such as green areas), and background social information that drive

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        We propose a web-based portal that will provide a variety of Idaho-specific climate-related
                        information in an accessible format.An accessible and user-friendly interface will provide
                        Idahoans with the climate-related resources they need to see what climatic extremes they are
                        vulnerable to in their region and how to stay healthy throughout them.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Accessibility of this information will help planning for more climate-friendly neighborhoods to
                        minimize the impacts of climate extremes in Idaho. It will also help a more equitable adaptation
                        to climate change in the Gem State. This portal is critical for Idaho public policymakers as the
                        Gem State observes huge growth rates.

                    <p>
                        The environment for this project will be Docker containers built within a Docker network.
                        This allows the project to be deployed to any infrastructure capable of running Docker with
                        the plan of deploying to Boise State University VM.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        The research for this portal has been completed through the Boise State University Civil
                        Engineering department which means the portal will need to be accessible on the
                        lab computers and virtually anyone with internet access.

                        <b>2.2 Assumptions and Limitations</b>
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The proposal assumes that with the given dataset from the sponsor, we will be able to create an
                        interactive map of Idaho where users will be able to filter through the different climate-related
                        health issues. We are assuming that all the chosen libraries and frameworks are free to use and
                        we will be able to learn how to use them through open-source documentation and online resources.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Development for this web-based application will be tested only on a desktop. While a mobile
                        device version of the site is possible with the chosen web frameworks and libraries, it will
                        not be a primary focus.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        This project has only a 10 week development period, which limits the ability to cover 100% of
                        unit and system testing, enhancements and style to the portal, and other items that might be
                        smoothed out over the course of a larger scoped project.

                        <b>2.3 Risks and Contingencies</b>
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Most of the architecture we have chosen to utilize is new to most team members, but we are using
                        the provided framework from the legacy project so we believe it will be feasible to learn.
                        Another risk is that we are not the owners of the given dataset for this portal so it might take
                        some development time to understand the dataset.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Finally, as with any time-constrained project, there is a chance that all listed criteria and
                        functional requirements will not be met.
